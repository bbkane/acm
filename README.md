My prompt:

> Please make me a website with vanilla html and css that says "Apostolic Chinese Ministries" at the top and embeds the following YouTube video in the middle - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mZIj2X1mTo . At the bottom it should have a link to the YouTube channel ( https://www.youtube.com/@apostolicchinese4531 ) and the email address jeff@apostolicchineseministries.org. The color scheme is white with spring colored accents (light green, etc.). It should be mobile friendly
